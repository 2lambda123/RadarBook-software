Launch the Python installer and follow the onscreen instructions. Once the installation iscomplete, ensure the following packages are installed by typing the following commands at the command prompt:

```markdown

> pip install scipy
> pip install matplotlib
> pip install pyqt5
```

Then install the libraries and examples associated with the text by typing *pip install -e **mypath**/pyradar', where **mypath** is the path to the folder 'pyradar'.

### MATLAB (R)
