This is the companion software for the book **_Introduction to Radar with Python and MATLAB&copy_ by Lee A. Harrison**.

### Python

The Python tools were developed with version 3.6.4 and the GUIs were developed with Qt 5.10.0.  The  tool  suite  makes  use  of  packages  including  SciPy,  NumPy and  Matplotlib. To install Python and the necessary packages begin by navigating to [Link](http://python.org) and downloading the installer for the operating system of choice. Launch the Python installer and follow the onscreen instructions. Once the installation iscomplete, ensure the following packages are installed by typing the following commands at the command prompt:

```markdown
> pip install numpy
> pip install scipy
> pip install matplotlib
> pip install pyqt5
```

Then install the libraries and examples associated with the text by typing *pip install -e **mypath**/pyradar*, where **mypath** is the path to the folder 'pyradar'.

### MATLAB&copy

MATLAB®combines  a  desktop  environment  tuned  for  iterative  analysis  and  designprocesses  with  a  programming  language  that  expresses  matrix  and  array  mathematicsdirectly. It includes the Live Editor for creating scripts that combine code, output, andformatted text in an executable notebook [15]. The MATLAB®scripts associated withthis  text  were  developed  with  R2018a  and  do  not  require  any  additional  toolboxes.In  order  to  run  the  MATLAB®scripts  provided  with  this  text,  the  library  folder  andsubfolders must be added to the MATLAB®path as shown in Figure 1.7. Once thesefolders have been added to the path, the MATLAB®scripts may be executed from theeditor as shown in Figure 1.8 or from the command window by typing the name of thescript
